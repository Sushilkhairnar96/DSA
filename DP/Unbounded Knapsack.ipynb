    "Rod cutting problem is very much related to any real-world problem we face. You have a rod of some size and you want to cut it into parts and sell in such a way that you get the maximum revenue out of it. Now, here is the catch, prices of different size of pieces are different and it is a possibility that a cutting into smaller pieces can fetch more revenue than selling a bigger piece, so a different strategy is needed.\n",

    "Before that, lets state the problem more formally,\n",
    "You are given a rod of size n >0, it can be cut into any number of pieces k (k â‰¤ n). Price for each piece of size i is represented as p(i) and maximum revenue from a rod of size i is r(i) (could be split into multiple pieces). Find r(n) for the rod of size n."
