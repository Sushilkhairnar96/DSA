    "Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is called as max heap and the latter is called min heap. The heap can be represented by binary tree or array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why array based representation for Binary Heap?\n",
    "Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as array and array based representation is space efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "How to build the heap?\n",
    "Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom up order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it is available using “heapq” module. The property of this data structure in python is that each time the smallest of heap element is popped(min heap). Whenever elements are pushed or popped, heap structure in maintained. The heap[0] element also returns the smallest element each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on heap :\n",
    "1. heapify(iterable) :- This function is used to convert the iterable into a heap data structure. i.e. in heap order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. heappush(heap, ele) :- This function is used to insert the element mentioned in its arguments into heap. The order is adjusted, so as heap structure is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. heappop(heap) :- This function is used to remove and return the smallest element from heap. The order is adjusted, so as heap structure is maintained.    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. heappushpop(heap, ele) :- This function combines the functioning of both push and pop operations in one statement, increasing efficiency. Heap order is maintained after this operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. heapreplace(heap, ele) :- This function also inserts and pops element in one statement, but it is different from above function. In this, element is first popped, then the element is pushed.i.e, the value larger than the pushed value can be returned. heapreplace() returns the smallest value originally in heap regardless of the pushed element as opposed to heappushpop().\n",
    "\n",
    "6. nlargest(k, iterable, key = fun) :- This function is used to return the k largest elements from the iterable specified and satisfying the key if mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. nsmallest(k, iterable, key = fun) :- This function is used to return the k smallest elements from the iterable specified and satisfying the key if mentioned."
